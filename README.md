# JWD Final Project: Task Planner App

This project is made for demonstrating our capability of using technical skills to create a simple dynamic web application - Task Planner App.

The purpose of this app is to create, manage, organise tasks for people to use, in an user-friendly web environment.

### The Functionalities

Task Planner has the following functionalities:

1. A clickable button to add a task

2. A pop-up modal, Task Form, to accommodate the input fields of Task Name, Description, Assign To, Status, and Due Date

3. A submit/save button to validate the form inputs and save the task

4. Each new task is visible on the card format (Task Card) with the task details in it

5. Task Card to render all information with a different status values of TODO, In Progress, Review, and Done

6. Each Task Card status matches with a different background colors of Red, Yellow, Orange, and Green respectively

7. Inside the Task Card, it has two buttons - "Done" and "Delete"

8. The "Done" button is for task that has completed. To mark it as done, click on it, the status will be updated as done in the value, and the "Done" button will be removed

9. "Delete" button deletes a Task Card from the Task Planner interface

10. All task data information to be stored, and stay the same when the app is closed and reopened
